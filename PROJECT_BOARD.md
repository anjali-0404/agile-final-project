# Final Project - GitHub Project (Kanban) setup

Create a repository project named **Final Project** and use the following columns (suggested):
- Icebox
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- In Progress
- Review/QA
- Done

## Steps to reproduce instructor tasks in GitHub
1. Create Issues using files in the `issues/` folder. Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue_template.md` when creating new issues.
2. Move issues for requirements 7 and 8 (list all products, query subset) to **Icebox**.
3. Move remaining issues to **Product Backlog**.
4. Conduct Backlog Refinement and rank Product Backlog to match stakeholder priority order (use the order of files inside `issues/` as the priority order).
5. Update the top 5 stories (already filled with Gherkin acceptance criteria in the provided issues).
6. Create label `technical debt` and other labels (see `labels.md`).
7. Create a Milestone named `Sprint` with 2-week duration and assign the top 4 stories to that milestone.
8. Conduct Sprint Planning: add top 4 stories to Sprint Backlog, assign estimates, and assign users.
9. Simulate sprint movements across columns as required.
10. Ensure burndown chart displays correctly (you can upload the `burndown.png` as an example and replace with your real chart exported from GitHub).
11. Paste your GitHub Project URL into `kanban_board_url.txt` for peer review.
